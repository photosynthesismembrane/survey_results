The clouds are also arranged in a way that they frame the central figure, the girl, and the cityscape, which helps to focus the viewer's attention on her.\n\nThe girl is positioned centrally in the composition, with her back to the viewer, looking out towards the horizon.

The reflection creates a symmetrical balance with the cityscape on the opposite side of the water.\n\nThe cityscape, with its lights and buildings, is situated on the right side of the painting, providing a counterbalance to the expansive sky and the open space of the water. The lights in the buildings create a sense of depth and dimension, contrasting with the flatness of the water and the sky.\n\nOverall, the balance in the composition is achieved through the use of a clear horizon line, the distribution of the clouds, the central placement of the girl, and the mirroring of the cityscape in the water.

The light source appears to be coming from the windows in the background, casting a warm glow on the figures and the bed, while the foreground is in relative darkness. This contrast helps to draw the viewer's eye towards the center of the composition, where the action is taking place.\n\nSecondly, the figures themselves present a contrast in terms of their size and position. The people in the foreground are larger and more detailed, suggesting they are closer to the viewer, while those in the background are smaller and less distinct, indicating they are further away. <span class=\"highlighted\">This spatial arrangement creates a sense of depth and perspective.</span>\n\nAdditionally, the contrast is also present in the attire of the figures. The clothing of the people in the foreground is more detailed and varied, with different colors and patterns, while the figures in the background wear simpler, more muted garments. This variation in clothing adds to the visual interest and complexity of the scene.\n\nLastly, the contrast is also present in the architectural elements of the room. The arches and columns in the background are more ornate and detailed than the walls and ceiling in the foreground, which are simpler and more subdued. This contrast in architectural elements adds to the overall visual richness of the painting.\n\nOverall, the contrast in this painting is achieved through the use of light and shadow, the arrangement of figures in terms of size and position, the variation in clothing, and the contrast in architectural elements.
